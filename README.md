# Controlled-Flight-of-High-DOF-Humanoid-Robot

## Abstract 

This work aims to expand the abilities of humanoid robots by implementing flying capabilities to the robot. Humanoid robots are designed to mimic the kinematics of a human, i.e. two arms, two legs, and a head. With this structure, humanoid robots can be designed and programmed to perform a variety of tasks. Some examples of full-body humanoid robots include Hubo, NAO, iCub (an open-source cognitive humanoid robotic platform), Atlas by Boston dynamics, Hondaâ€™s ASIMO, Valkyrie from NASA. Some examples of upper body humanoid robots, i.e. humanoid robots with wheels and tracks instead of legs, include Handle by Boston Dynamics and Mitra by Invento Robotics. Increasing mobility options for humanoid robots make them more versatile. In this work, we work towards adding the mobility option of flying to the humanoid robot. This is done by adding thrusters to the end-effectors of its high degree of freedom (DOF) arms, we then use control methodology for stabilization. Specifically, in this work, we study the ability of the latter robot to stabilize over the rotation in the x-axis. To test our algorithms, we built the physical robot via additive and subtractive manufacturing methods. We utilized computer-aided design (CAD) as well as computer-aided machining (CAM) during the manufacturing of the robot.
This resulted in a 6-DOF upper body of a humanoid robot with ducted fans on its end-effectors that operates in the coronal plane. A test fixture that allows for full motion of the robot and ground truth measurement was also created. We used system identification to create a mathematical model of the dynamics of the robot. This model was then used to design a controller for stabilization over the x-axis. We applied this controller in a simulation then confirmed our results on the physical robot. In the results, we were able to achieve stability over the x-axis with an overshoot of about 20% and a settling time of approximately 2.0 seconds.
